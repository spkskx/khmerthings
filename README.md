# khmerthings

Deterministic Khmer language tools for Python — built as **community
building blocks**: small, correct, dependency-free primitives you can
compose into bigger systems.

No machine-learning models, no third-party NLP dependencies, no network
calls. Every result is reproducible and explainable. Khmer script writes no
spaces between words, so even "simple" operations like counting or sorting
need real language handling — khmerthings implements that from first
principles.

## Tools

Each tool is available both as a Python API and a CLI subcommand, and has
its own detailed document:

| Tool | CLI | Python | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Word breaker** — split Khmer text into words | `khmerthings segment` | `break_words`, `mark_boundaries` | [docs/word-breaker.md](docs/word-breaker.md) |
| **Word counter** — count words in Khmer/mixed text | `khmerthings count` | `count_words`, `analyze` | [docs/word-counter.md](docs/word-counter.md) |
| **Line sorter** — Khmer dictionary-order sorting | `khmerthings sort` | `sort_lines`, `khmer_sort_key` | [docs/line-sorter.md](docs/line-sorter.md) |
| **Spellchecker** — find Khmer misspellings & unknown words | `khmerthings spellcheck` | `check_spelling` | [docs/spellcheck.md](docs/spellcheck.md) |
| **Spellfixer** — rewrite known misspellings to canonical | `khmerthings spellfix` | `fix_spelling` | [docs/spellfix.md](docs/spellfix.md) |
| **Normalizer** — spellfix + re-space into clean, ready-to-use text | `khmerthings normalize` | `normalize_text` | [docs/normalize.md](docs/normalize.md) |
| **Condenser** — strip function words, keep only content words | `khmerthings condense` | `condense_text`, `content_words` | [docs/condense.md](docs/condense.md) |
| **Romanizer** — phonetically romanize Khmer into Latin | `khmerthings romanize` | `romanize` | [docs/romanize.md](docs/romanize.md) |
| **Numerals** — convert digits & spell numbers in Khmer | `khmerthings numerals` | `arabic_to_khmer`, `khmer_to_arabic`, `number_to_words` | [docs/numerals.md](docs/numerals.md) |
| **Orthography validator** — report definite Khmer encoding-structure errors | `khmerthings validate` | `validate_orthography` | [docs/orthography.md](docs/orthography.md) |

## Install

```sh
pip install khmerthings         # library
uv tool install khmerthings     # global CLI
```

Or install the CLI with one command (installs `uv` first when needed):

```sh
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spkskx/khmerthings/main/install.sh | sh
```

Requires macOS or Linux. Verify the install with `khmerthings --help`.

Update or remove the CLI from the same command:

```sh
khmerthings update      # upgrade with uv tool, pipx, or pip (detected from the install)
khmerthings uninstall   # asks y/N, then removes the package the same way
```

## A taste

```sh
$ echo "ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់ភាសាខ្មែរ" | khmerthings segment
ខ្ញុំ ស្រឡាញ់ ភាសា ខ្មែរ
```

```python
from khmerthings import break_words, count_words, fix_spelling, sort_lines

break_words("ខ្ញុំស្រឡាញ់ភាសាខ្មែរ")   # ['ខ្ញុំ', 'ស្រឡាញ់', 'ភាសា', 'ខ្មែរ']
count_words("ខ្ញុំមានឆ្កែ ២ ក្បាល and 3 cats")   # 8
sort_lines(["ក្រ", "កា", "កក"])                    # ['កក', 'កា', 'ក្រ']
fix_spelling("ខ្ញុំសំរាប់ការងារ")                  # 'ខ្ញុំសម្រាប់ការងារ'
```

## Design principles

- **Deterministic**: same input, same output, always. Rule- and
  dictionary-based algorithms only; nothing probabilistic.
- **Self-contained**: zero runtime dependencies; all word data is our own
  hand-curated set of growable wordlists — `words` (core vocabulary),
  `names` (people's names & titles), `modern` (slang, loanwords, trending
  terms), `variants` (common misspellings mapped to their canonical
  spelling), `stopwords` (function words tagged by category, for the
  condenser), and `romanize` (whole-word Latin spellings, for the romanizer)
  — 1,900+ entries and growing, each verified entry by entry; no wordlist is
  imported wholesale.
- **Lossless**: no character is ever dropped — unknown Khmer spans are
  reported, not discarded. (The one exception is the condenser, which is
  lossy by design — it *removes* function words.)
- **Tested first**: every module ships with table-driven unit tests and
  invariant checks (500+ tests and growing).

Under the hood, the tools share deterministic primitives (character
classification, character-cluster segmentation, a cluster-keyed lexicon
trie, lossless tokenization) in `src/khmerthings/` — see the module
docstrings if you want to build on them directly.

## Roadmap

The deterministic tool surface is **complete and frozen** — the focus now is
depth, not breadth: growing the data and hardening what's already here.

- ✅ Word counter, line sorter, word breaker, spellchecker & spellfixer,
  normalizer, condenser (content-word extraction), romanizer, numerals,
  orthography validator
- ⏳ Wordlist growth across all four sources (`words`, `names`, `modern`,
  `variants`) plus the condenser's `stopwords` list — hand-curated batches
  each release; the accuracy lever for every dictionary-based tool, including
  the spellchecker's verdicts, suggestions, and fixes
- ⏳ Quality & correctness — known-answer regression suites for the romanizer
  and sorter, invariant/edge-case hardening, and profiling of the hot paths

**Out of scope / not planned:** semantic ("understanding-level") NLP that
would require probabilistic models — intent detection, paragraph
categorization, and POS tagging are intentionally *not* on the roadmap. They
conflict with the determinism guarantee; content extraction uses the curated
stoplist instead.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for setup, the architecture,
the rules (determinism, self-owned data, tests first), and how to add
words to the lexicon — the single most valuable contribution. This project
